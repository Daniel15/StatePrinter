    </description>
    <releaseNotes>
      * Added assertion helper methods Stateprinter.Assert.AreEqual, Stateprinter.Assert.IsSame, Stateprinter.Assert.PrintIsSame and Stateprinter.Assert.That. 
      * Added automatic write and re-write of expected values in unit tests. You provide the SUT and the call the stuff, StatePrinter providesthe expected values for your pleasurable inspection.
      * Improves the unit test experience by printing a suggested expected string as C# code.
      * Added configuration of how line-endings are generated during state printing. This is to mitigate problems due to different operating systems uses different line-endings.
      * Added a AllFieldsAndPropertiesHarvester which is able to harvest properties and fields.
      * StringConverter is now configurable with respect to quote character.
      * BREAKING CHANGE: Projective harvester is now using the AllFieldsAndPropertiesHarvester rather instead of the FieldHarvester. This means both fields and properties are now harvested.
      * BREAKING CHANGE: The deprecated type StatePrinter is now deleted. Use Stateprinter instead.
